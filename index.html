        <p>You'll want anyone viewing your resume to be easily taken in by your hard skills and experience. But it's also important to make sure your resume is focused on achievements, not just day-to-day tasks. If you've led a team, launched a project, won a prize, or so on, be sure that's included in your write-ups of the positions you've held. </p>
